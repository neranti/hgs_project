		This website, essentially, is my demo website for what will eventually turn out to be the website for my business to come. Though I am not sure what this website might sprout into, I have some ideas. This website shows my knowledge of HTML, (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. This knowledge, I gained from the Hidden Genius project and outside studies as well. I was guided by the mentors in the hidden genius project along with online coding sources to successfully make this website.<br><br>
