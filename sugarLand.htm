<h1>“A Fate Worse Than Slavery, Unearthed in Sugar Land” - Reaction</h1>
<h5>By - Brent Staples

<hr>
<p style="padding-right: 10%; padding-left: 10%;">The history of Sugar Land, Texas is another example of how even after slavery, enslavers sought to continue their gain off of Africans. When a school in Sugar Land was being built, bodies of Africans from the post-slavery era were found. After emancipation, laws were emplaced to easily jail Africans making jail labor the new slave labor. Sugar Land, Texas got its name due to its horrific history with Africans. By doing jail labor, Africans worked in sugar fields, cutting cane and supplying it to the mill. Many Africans, while feeding the cane into the mill, have their hand cut off or are dragged into the mill.</p>

<p style="padding-right: 10%; padding-left: 10%;">	We can use this knowledge of Sugar Land, Texas to see how African Americans are still treated today. We are still underappreciated even though times have changed. African Americans have gone from being physically enslaved to now mentally enslaved. Countless murders and crimes against African Americans still occur today just as much as in the past. Many places, like Sugar Land, Texas, are trying to hide and cover up this past but instead, it should be acknowledged and recognized.
