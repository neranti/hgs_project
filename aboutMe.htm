<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>

<div class="animate fadeInLeft"><p style="padding-left: 200px; padding-right: 200px;">My name is Neranti Gary and this is my website. As of now, I am a freshman at Moreau Catholic High School. I enjoy computer technology and this website is just a product of my all my hard work and knowledge. I hope as a career I can participate in the technology field, as perhaps a software developer. I eventually hope to start my own tech business after college. The Hidden Genius Project has already guided me in that direction by providing me and all of the geniuses entrepreneur classes. I know that there are a great number of opportunities in the technology and I want to be a part of that.
